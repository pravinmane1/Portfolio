      <span style="font-size: 2rem">👋</span> Hi, I'm Pravin, a
      <span>full stack software engineer</span>. My story with web development
      started long back in 2014 when I tried to build a simple website<span
        style="font-size: 1.25rem"
        >💻</span
      >
      using HTML and CSS, see it come to life on a screen was exciting and
      ignited my passion for coding.

      Inspired by the endless possibilities of technology, I decided to dive
      deeper into computer engineering
      <span style="font-size: 1.5rem">🎓</span> in 2016, during engineering I
      learnt android and
      <span
