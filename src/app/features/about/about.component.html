      <span style="font-size: 2rem">👋</span> Hi, I'm Pravin, a
      <span>full stack software engineer</span>. My story with web development
      started long back in 2014 when I tried to build a simple website<span
        style="font-size: 1.25rem"
        >💻</span
      >
      using HTML and CSS, see it come to life on a screen was exciting and
      ignited my passion for coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by the endless possibilities of technology, I decided to dive
      deeper into computer engineering
      <span style="font-size: 1.5rem">🎓</span> in 2016, during engineering I
      learnt android and
      <span
        >built multiple <span style="font-size: 1.5rem">📱</span>android
        applications</span
      >
      as my side interest even freelanced few projects.
    </p>

          >SLB <span style="font-size: 1.25rem">🏢</span></a
        ></span
      >
      in 2020 where I got opportunity to explore web development. I developed my
      expertise in
      <span> Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET Core </span
      ><span style="font-size: 1.25rem">👨🏻‍💻</span>which I used to contribute in
